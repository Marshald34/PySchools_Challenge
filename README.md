# PySchools_Challenge

**Overview:**

The purpose of this analysis is to see if there are any correlations between the amount of spending per student and the overall passing percentage for the students. We also removed Thomas High School from the metrics to see if there was much of a change in the data. The reason we removed Thomas High was because there were some reports of academic dishonesty. 

**Results:**

The schools with the smaller amount of students tend to do better in every category when it comes to passing math and reading and passing overall. 
District schools appear to have worse grades than charter schools because they have a significantly more students.

Replacing the 9th graders at Thomas High School made the school look better. When removing the 9th garders data in the school summary dataframe, the overall passing went from 65% to 90%. The average math and reading scores stayed the same but with fewer students in the sample, the percentages in all categories increased.
